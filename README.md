# UniMarket

UniMarket is a mobile application designed for university students to buy, sell, or give away used items
within their campus community. The app provides an easy and secure way for students especially those who
are graduating or moving to exchange items such as mini-fridges, books, desks, or clothes with other
students on campus.
